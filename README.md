# 🏃‍♂️ Dawn-Dash 💨

An open-source **speedrun visualization** tool for the mobile RPG: [Dawncaster](https://dawncaster.wanderlost.games/).

- 📉 Speedrun charts of record-breaking runs and player progressions, for all modes and difficulties of the game.
- 🔍 Various filters and sorting options to focus on the runs you want to see.
- 🔗 And if you submitted your run via the official [Dawncaster Discord](https://discord.gg/pfeMG9c), your **Discord name** will be linked to your run!

... So, did **your** _super-speedy_ run make it on to the list? 👀

**Take a look**:
