# 🏃‍♂️ Dawn-Dash 💨

An open-source **speedrun visualization** tool for the mobile RPG: [Dawncaster](https://dawncaster.wanderlost.games/).

- 📉 Speedrun charts of record-breaking runs and player progressions, for all modes and difficulties of the game.
- 🔍 Various filters and sorting options to focus on the runs you want to see.
- 🔗 And if you submitted your run via the official [Dawncaster Discord](https://discord.gg/pfeMG9c), your **Discord name** will be linked to your run!

... So, did **your** _super-speedy_ run make it on to the list? 👀

**Take a look**:

## 🎴 The Cardex

There is also a **Card Codex** tool, supporting muli-keyword-search, advanced filtering, card-tracking and more! 🃏

Mainly tailored towards the **Weekly Challenges**, this tool lets you:
 - 🔍 Look up several cards at once based on given keywords.
 - 🧮 Filter based on card sets, banners, rarities, and more.
 - 🏹 And track the cards as you progress through your run collecting them!

 **Check it out here**:

## 🧺 Anything else?

Oh yes there is defintiely a few more things in progress... 👀 But it's a bit too soon to reveal (unless you go snooping around in the codebase yourself...)

**More stuff coming soon!**
