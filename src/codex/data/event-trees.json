At first, it's just a flicker of movement, barely perceptible. But then, the scene starts to come to life. The soldier begins to move, struggling against invisible bonds, his face contorted with fear and pain. As you watch, the scene becomes more and more gruesome. Blood spatters the walls of the painting, and the soldier's face contorts in agony as a ragged spear skewers its body. It's a terrifying sight, and you feel a deep sense of unease as you watch. But just as suddenly as it began, the scene comes to an abrupt end. The painting returns to its still state, the soldier once again frozen in time. You're left standing there, shaken by the experience. The power of the spell that trapped the soldier inside the painting is evident, and you can't help but wonder what other horrors might be lurking inside the walls of the mansion.",

It's clear they are trying to enter a vault, but something has gone terribly wrong. As you watch, the scene becomes more and more frantic. The thief's body twists and turns, sweat pouring down their face as they try to escape whatever has trapped him inside the painting. But it's no use.

The earth shakes, fires ignite the very air around you as the corrupted denizens of this world flee before your very presence. You know the betrayer is here - you know he shouldn't be. It has fallen on you to end the now mortal life of the being you once called an equal, and purge this abomination of a world from the tapestry of time. The heart of his corruption is not far. You draw your weapon, and are met with equal force. A deadly dance insues, one you can not lose for death holds no dominion over you. Or can you? Your heavenly fury is met with a strange, unfamiliar opposition. A desire to live. To be. It pushes you back, until you feel the betrayer strike a blow that ends your conscious thought for a moment. Expecting your divine reincarnation, you wait. And wait. And wait... As you look up, you see sunlight break through the top windows. Your mind your own once more, you notice the screams of the demons above have died along with their masters. It feels like, for the first time in a long while, you're able to draw a deep, satisfying breath. The old mage steps up behind you, tapping his gnarled staff against the fallen angel. \"Impressive, Dawncaster. You've succeeded where many, many others have failed - this world owes you a debt it won't be able to repay you, but such is the fate of heroes.\" You feel the mage's words ring true, today was not just a victory for you, but for the entirety of Aethos, ending a deadly and ancient threat from deep within the bowels of this strange, uncertain world.",
