You draw your weapon, and are met with equal force. A deadly dance insues, one you can not lose for death holds no dominion over you. Or can you? Your heavenly fury is met with a strange, unfamiliar opposition. A desire to live. To be. It pushes you back, until you feel the betrayer strike a blow that ends your conscious thought for a moment. Expecting your divine reincarnation, you wait. And wait. And wait... As you look up, you see sunlight break through the top windows. Your mind your own once more, you notice the screams of the demons above have died along with their masters. It feels like, for the first time in a long while, you're able to draw a deep, satisfying breath. The old mage steps up behind you, tapping his gnarled staff against the fallen angel. \"Impressive, Dawncaster. You've succeeded where many, many others have failed - this world owes you a debt it won't be able to repay you, but such is the fate of heroes.\" You feel the mage's words ring true, today was not just a victory for you, but for the entirety of Aethos, ending a deadly and ancient threat from deep within the bowels of this strange, uncertain world.",

Perhaps once and for all, ending the dark occupation of Aethos, and ushering in a new era, with a brighter future for mankind in this strange, vast universe.",
