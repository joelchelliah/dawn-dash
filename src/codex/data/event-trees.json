But then, the scene starts to come to life. The thief's body begins to move, and you can see them struggling with something just out of view. It's clear they are trying to enter a vault, but something has gone terribly wrong. As you watch, the scene becomes more and more frantic. The thief's body twists and turns, sweat pouring down their face as they try to escape whatever has trapped him inside the painting. But it's no use. With a final gasp, the thief slumps to the ground, their body still as the spell takes them. The painting returns to its still state, the thief once again frozen in time. You're left standing there, a sense of dread settling in your stomach. If the count and countess are capable of this kind of magic, what other dark secrets might be hidden inside the walls of their mansion?",

You move forward, descending into the secrets of the inner sanctum, a chance of redemption weighing heavy on your shoulders.",

Until next time, wanderer.\" You step off the boat onto a cold, stone platform. Ahead, darkness beckons, almost as if calling your name. You move forward, descending into the secrets of the inner sanctum, a chance of redemption weighing heavy on your shoulders.",
