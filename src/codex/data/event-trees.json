The soldier begins to move, struggling against invisible bonds, his face contorted with fear and pain. As you watch, the scene becomes more and more gruesome.

These borderland mercenaries can aid us in training our troops and improving our fortifications.\" If the Radiant Crusade is successful in breaking into Umbris, we can funnel new forces to join the Dawnbringer while strengthening our supply lines and fall back position near the border. The two nobles fall silent, their faces thoughtful as they consider the compromise. They exchange glances and while neither noble wants to admit defeat, they both seem to consider the argument a suitable compromise. Without a word, they turn and leave the room, each lost in their own thoughts.",
